Theorem(first variation formula) 
    'embedding $i$'  ---> 
    'embedding $i: L \hookrightarrow M$'

First efinition in 3.1 section
    '$i_{X_i^\#}\omega=d \langle \mu (p), X_i^\# \rangle = d \mu_i$' --->
    '$i_{X_i^\#}\omega=d \langle \mu (p), X_i \rangle = d \mu_i$]'

Theorem A, after Vol(Nt, g) = Vol(π(Nt), g ̃).
    elaborated a little on the proof so it becomes clearer

In introduction
     Also, based on the note of A.Mironov and T.Panov~\cite{MP2}, we give an explicit construction of H-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic toric manifolds, which generalizes the result of A.Mironov.  --->
     Also, based on the note of A.Mironov and T.Panov~\cite{MP2} where they refer to the results of Y.Dong, we give an explicit construction and independent proof of H-minimality of Lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic toric manifolds, which generalize the result of A.Mironov.

proposition 4.2
    The key observation is that the function $\Vo$ is invariant under the involution $\sigma \colon V_P$ induced by the complex conjugation. Indeed, the volume of an orbit depends only on the absolute values of the coordinates of points in this orbit. We have ---->
    The key observation is that the function $\Vo$ (volume of the preimage) is invariant under the involution $\sigma \colon V_P$ induced by the complex conjugation. This is because conjugation is isometry on $\mathbb{C}^m$. In fact the volume of an orbit depends only on absolute values of the coordinates of points in the orbit. Thus we have

    added smoe notations and clarifications:
    1)matrix $\Gamma \Delta$ is obtained by placing the matrix $\Gamma$ right on top of the matrix $\Delta$
    2)Z_\Gamma \cap Z_\Delta is changed Z_{\Gamma \Delta}
    and all other elements are denoted correspondingly
    3)changed the commutative diagram
    4)The groups $T_\Delta$ and $D_\Delta$ are defined similarly as the groups $T_\Gamma$ and $D_\Gamma$ --->
    The groups $T_\Delta$, $T_{\Gamma \Delta}$, $D_\Delta$, and $D_{\Gamma \Delta}$ are defined similarly as the groups $T_\Gamma$ and $D_\Gamma$. Notice that $n+l$ should be $\ge m$ and $T_\Gamma^{m-n}$ is transverse to $T_\Delta^{m-l}$ inside $T_{\Gamma \Delta}^{2m-n-l} \subset T^m$, and all these three tori act freely on $Z_{\Gamma \Delta}$.
    5)added the proof of theorem C
